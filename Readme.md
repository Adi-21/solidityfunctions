Functions :-
This Solidity program demonstrates the basic syntax and functionality of the Solidity programming language based on Functions. The purpose of this program is to serve as a starting point for those who are new to Solidity and want to get a feel for how it works.

Description :-
This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. This program serves as a simple and straightforward introduction to Solidity programming using Functions, and can be used as a stepping stone for more complex projects in the future.

Getting Started
Executing program
To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., Functions.sol). Copy and paste the following code into the file:

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.17" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile Functions.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "Functions" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.
